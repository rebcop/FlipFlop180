## My process

### Built with

- CSS and Bootstrap Layout
- JavaScript Fundamentals
- JavaScript Loops
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation
- Boolean Logic
- TECH STACK: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

### What I learned

1. A for loop can be used to loop through a string as if it's an array.

2. Everything retrieved from the HTML comes in as a string even if it has a type="number" on the element.
